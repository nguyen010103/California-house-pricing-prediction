# California-house-pricing-prediction

This project uses the California Census housing dataset to median home values based on features like population, location, and house characteristics.

---

## Goals 
- Explore the dataset and understanding the data trend.
- Train machine learning models to predict house prices.
- Create visualizations
- Publish results and code in a clean, reproducible format.

--- 

## Features Analysis Summary

### Median Income
- The distribution is right-skewd, meaning the most housholds were earning below average income in the dataset.
- Income is positively correlated with house value.

### Housing Age
- The distribution is fairly uniform.
- Not very informative on its own.

### Correlation Heat Map
- Median_income has a strong positive linear relationship - use a core predictor.
- Avg_rooms and avg_bedrooms have low correlation with the house value - combine for better use.
- Combining latitude and longitude via clustering.
- Consider dropping population and average_occupants to reduce noise.

### Latitude and Longitude
- Generate California house price per location.

--- 

## Engineered dataset
- Combine avg_rooms and avg_bedrooms because both of them had a high correlation to each other. Using both will be redundant.
- Drop the column due to low or near zero correlation with the house median price: populations, avg_bedrooms and avg_rooms

## Machine Learning - Model 

### Models Evaluated
| Model               | RMSE | MAE  | RÂ²     |
|--------------------|------|------|--------|
| Linear Regression   | 0.74 | 0.54 | 0.582  |
| Decision Tree       | 0.74 | 0.54 | 0.583  |
| **Random Forest**  | **0.51** | **0.31** | **0.803** |

> **Random Forest** achieved the best performance and is selected as the final model.

## Visualizations
- Residual plots and actual vs. predicted plots
- Feature importances
- Model performance comparison bar chart

## Feature Importance
- Top driver: `median_income`, followed by location features (`latitude`, `longitude`) and household characteristics.

---

## Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis

---

## Conclusion

- The model achieved strong predictive accuracy.
- `Median income` is the most powerful predictor of home values.
- Geographic and household density features also significantly influence housing prices.
